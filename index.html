<tr><td>
    Computers have always been a passion of mine, since I watched and (allegedly) helped her build one. I have worked in IT fields since I left school and have uncovered a further passion for software development. The ability to create an interactive, usable experience from nothing but lines of code is truly an exciting experience. <br/> I enjoy learning new things and with the constantly developing world of software development, I know there will be plenty to learn in the years to come.<br> I hope every day, that no one ever finds this... </td>

<! A footer with a little bit more explanation on a meme on on my exployment history>
<footer>A personal note from me: The employment gap you see above, were my yachting years.. Although i gained valuable life experiences, the work experience is as compatible with a career in IT as water is to a motherboard. Feel free to ask me any questions and I'll happily share some stories with you!<br>
P.S - The tagline is a reference to a really old meme, you can find it - <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/graphic-design-is-my-passion" target="_blank">here</a></footer>
